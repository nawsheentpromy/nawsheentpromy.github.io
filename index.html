        <p> I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico, specializing in computational genetics and evolutionary biology. My research focuses on the evolution of genetic architecture in heterogeneous environments, working under the guidance of Dr. Davorka Gulisija. I have been involved in research since 2021, with a diverse academic background including a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.</p>
        <p> My research experience extends to applied computational projects as a Summer Research Intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2024. Additionally, I have taught and assisted in various university courses, both in computer science and biology, and served as a lecturer in Bangladesh. </p>
        <p> Beyond academia, I am involved in student leadership and mentoring programs, including serving as the President of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association and Treasurer for Women in Computing at UNM. </p>
        <p> I have published multiple research papers in areas ranging from evolutionary biology to smart systems for traffic congestion reduction, and I am passionate about advancing computational research for real-world applications. </p>
